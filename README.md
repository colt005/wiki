# Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built using Golang, HTML, Tailwindcss and Templ. The site showcases my projects, skills, and experience. I wanted to create this site for a long time because I've always disliked working with HTML and CSS but loved using Golang. So, I decided to try building my portfolio using a technology stack that leverages Golang to handle both backend and frontend rendering.


## Technologies Used

- Golang: Backend language used to serve pages and handle requests.
- Templ: A Go-based templating engine that simplifies rendering views.
